        <h1>Welcome, My Love!</h1>
        <p>You are the most special person in my life. I am so sorry for everything and I love you more than anything in this world.</p>
        <p>Here is a little something to make you smile:</p>
        <p>I know things aren't great between us right now, and I've been giving you the space you need. But I have to be honestâ€”I've been feeling really low and overwhelmed by everything. It's been tough not talking to you, and it's affecting me more than I thought it would.

I really need to clear the air and make things right. You're too important to me to leave things like this.</p>
