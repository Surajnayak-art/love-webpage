            <p>You are the love of my life, and I cherish every moment with you.</p>
            <p>You are perfect just the way you are, and I love you more than anything!</p>
            <p>I'm so sorry for everything, and I hope this small gesture shows how much I care.</p>

            <p>[I know things aren't great between us right now, and I've been giving you the space you need. But I have to be honestâ€”I've been feeling really low and overwhelmed by everything. It's been tough not talking to you, and it's affecting me more than I thought it would.

I really need to clear the air and make things right. You're too important to me to leave things like this.]</p>
